# Everything for Exit Nodes

Our starting point is: https://github.com/V-Shadbolt/ud-doh-resolver/  
(Thanks to Vincent Shadbolt of Unstoppable Domains for the quick creation of that repo!)  
So essentially all that is left is to add logic to include onion records and we have an onion/ipfs resolver which uses Unstoppable Domains as the human readable reference.  

The above repo will be modified and stored in the hybrid-resolver directory.
